# Project-2-Group-Assignment

Hey everyone, this is the repository for our group assignment for Project 2 where we will all contribute and branch our projects as we work together. We'll have a google meet call and I'll show you guys how to successfully configure GitHub in your Intergrated Development Environment and branch projects without losing or conflicting any of our code.
